# Stream Demo: Building a Simple Dragonchain Smart Contract in Node.JS

This repo is the (extremely) simple "calculator" smart contract built live on stream at [https://twitch.tv/FitzyCodesThings](https://twitch.tv/FitzyCodesThings)

The contract is built on top of Node.js and was deployed to an operational level 1 Dragonchain business node.

For much more detail on getting started with Dragonchain and building smart contracts in ANY language (that can be run inside a Docker container), check out [my blog](https://herebedrgns.com/project-baby-devs-first-dragonchain-smart-contract/)
